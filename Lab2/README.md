# Computational Intelligence - Laboratory 2 - NIM GAME
Nim is a strategic, two-player mathematical game played with piles of objects, such as stones or matchsticks. The objective is to force your opponent to remove the last object from the last pile. The game begins with multiple piles, and players take turns removing objects from a single pile of their choice. Each turn requires the removal of at least one object.
